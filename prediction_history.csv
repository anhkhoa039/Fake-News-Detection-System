In a statement on Thursday night, Buckingham Palace said the King's brother will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.

Andrew gave up his other royal titles earlier this month, including the Duke of York, after facing more questions about his private life.

In a posthumous memoir published earlier this month, Virginia Giuffre repeated allegations that, as a teenager, she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions. Andrew has always denied the claims.

Reacting to the latest developments, Ms Giuffre's family said she ""brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage"". Giuffre took her own life earlier this year.

In its statement, the Palace said the King ""has today initiated a formal process to remove the style, titles and honours of Prince Andrew"".",Real News,1.0,2025-10-31 07:15:00.161122

admin,"Gov. Charlie Crist launched what amounts to a nuclear attack in Republican politics during his FOX News Sunday showdown with Marco Rubio.
Crist labeled Rubio, the former House speaker, a tax raiser.
In a back and forth about each other's record on tax issues, Crist singled out Rubio's failed 2007 plan that would have eliminated property taxes for many Floridians in exchange for an increase to the state sales tax.
The tax swap ""would have been a massive tax increase,"" Crist said during the March 28, 2010, U.S. Senate debate. ""In all due respect to the speaker, you've just got to tell the truth to people. And that's really what this is all about.""
Rubio contends that the tax swap would have been a huge, net tax cut. And that the plan was supported by former Gov. Jeb Bush.
Would it have been a tax cut? Or a tax hike?
Let's take a look.
In his first months as speaker in early 2007, Rubio proposed a fundamental change in Florida's tax structure. The proposal would scratch property taxes on all primary residences. In its place, the state sales tax would be increased by 2.5 cents per dollar -- subject to voter approval.
A House analysis originally said the swap would save taxpayers a total of $5.8 billion in the first year, which certainly is contrary to Crist's claim.
But whether you saved money or spent more money at the end of the year likely depended on your individual circumstances. Back in 2007, the St. Petersburg Times ran calculations under Rubio's proposal for both homeowners and renters.
The homeowners
A family of four with an annual income of $64,280. Home value: $241,100
CURRENT
Property tax bill in Tampa: $5,061.06
Sales taxes paid: $951
PROPOSED
Property tax bill in Tampa: $0
Sales taxes paid: $1,290
Under Rubio's plan, these homeowners would have paid $4,722 less in state taxes, the Times found. Contrast that with renters:
The renters
A family of two with an annual income of $46,914
CURRENT
Rent: $851
Sales taxes paid: $691
PROPOSED
Rent: $851
Sales taxes paid: $937
Under Rubio's plan, these renters would pay an additional $246 a year in taxes. The rental property owners also would still have to pay property taxes, meaning rent wouldn't be affected.
""He talked about it being a swap, and it would be a swap because those who owned their home wouldn't have to pay a tax anymore,"" Crist said during the debate. ""Forty percent of my fellow Floridians are renters. It would not have applied to them at all. All they would have enjoyed is his tax increase.""
Rubio responded: ""The renters would have had an opportunity to buy now because the exorbitant taxes that we pay on property in Florida would not have gone up.""
Conversely Rubio pointed out that the increased sales tax would bring more revenue into the state from non-resident visitors. If tourists contribute more, he said, Floridians contribute less.
Rubio's proposal got the seal of approval from Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and a Rubio supporter. In 2007, he wrote legislators saying Rubio's tax swap proposal amounted to a net tax cut.
""Speaker Rubio‚Äôs proposal is a net tax cut, thus a vote for the proposal would not constitute a violation of the Taxpayer Protection Pledge,"" Norquist wrote . ""All taxpayers of Florida would reap the benefits of a lower tax burden and significant spending restraint on the state as well as on the local level.""
A later House study said the sales tax increase would generate $9.3 billion in exchange for eliminating $15.8 billion in property taxes. ( Here's a House analysis of the swap, which was combined with other tax initiatives).
""Only in Tallahassee could a bunch of politicians declare that a $7 billion net tax savings is a tax increase,"" Rep. Adam Hasner, R-Delray Beach, told the Palm Beach Post .
Yet some did vote against the proposal saying it was a tax increase . The swap ultimately was killed by the state Senate.
Crist spokeswoman Andrea Saul noted that Rubio himself said the tax swap was a tax increase during the March 28, 2010, debate. According to transcripts, Rubio said: ""Well, let me tell you about that supposed program to raise taxes that he keeps talking about. It was probably the largest tax increase in Florida's history. It would have eliminated property taxes for all sorts of people. And it was supported by (none other) than Jeb Bush.""
A Rubio spokesman, Alberto Martinez, said Rubio mispoke. ""Not shocking they would try to distort that,"" Martinez said.
Based on the statements that surround Rubio's ""largest tax increase""  line, it seems reasonable to us that he meant to say decrease.
Back to Crist. He said Rubio's tax swap proposal ""would have been a massive tax increase."" At its most basic level, Rubio's proposal was a tax increase and a tax decrease. The state sales tax would go up, and the property taxes would go down. On the micro level, some people would pay more and others would pay less. At the macro level, two different studies said Floridians would have paid less -- between $5.8 billion and $6.5 billion. While generally we are leery about tax impact projections, there is no suggestion Rubio's plan would have resulted in a tax increase statewide and certainly not a ""massive"" one as Crist suggests.",Real News,0.9,2025-10-31 07:19:08.108175
admin,"U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-3rd, was not pleased with the debt limit deal that became law earlier this month.
He said the measure will lead to deep cuts to programs that help needy families, students and seniors while keeping George W. Bush-era tax cuts that benefit the middle-class and wealthy. Scott has long called for ending the tax reductions.
""The estimated savings of this deal only pay for half of the cost of extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts for another decade,"" Scott said in an Aug. 1 news release.
Do the savings in the debt deaI come to half the price of keeping the Bush tax cuts? We decided to check.
First some background. The deal passed by Congress earlier this month expanded the nation‚Äôs debt limit to $16.4 trillion -- a $2.1 trillion increase the will give the federal government enough money to pay its bills until early 2013.
The measure requires Congress to cut $2.4 trillion out of the budget over the next 10 years in order to meet or exceed the size of the debt ceiling increase.
The deal calls for $900 billion in cuts up front. A recently appointed bipartisan deficit reduction panel is charged with finding an additional $1.5 trillion that could come from spending cuts and revenue hikes, though House Republicans could still block any move to increase taxes.
If the committee deadlocks, there‚Äôs a trigger in the legislation that would enact $1.2 trillion of cuts to domestic and defense spending.
So the total reduction would be at least $2.1 trillion and could as much as $2.4 trillion.
Scott, in a phone interview, said he used the $2.1 trillion figure in his comparison of spending reductions to the 10-year cost of extending the Bush tax cuts.
Jason Peuquest, a policy analyst with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Scott is justified in using the lower figure. ""It seems the $2.1 (trillion) is what people are focusing on most because the goal of the super committee is backed up by this automatic trigger,"" he said.
Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agreed. He said there is ""at least an even chance"" that the deficit panel will not reach an agreement, forcing the total of $2.1 trillion in spending reductions.
The Bush tax cuts were enacted in 2001 and 2003 and scheduled to expire in 2010. Congress, at the end of last year, extended them through 2012.
Scott pointed us to Congressional Budget Office reports that say the total cost of keeping the tax cuts through 2020 is $3.9 trillion.  Of that amount, $3.3 trillion comes from lost revenues and the cost of interest payments needed to service the additional debt caused by the tax relief.
The remaining $600 billion is the cost of maintaining adjustments to the Alternative Minimum Tax. The Bush tax cuts required many Americans who had once itemized their  returns to pay the more expensive AMT. As a result, about 20 million Americans lost part or all of the benefits of the tax relief. Congress came to their aid by increasing AMT exemptions.
Three analysts said it‚Äôs legitimate to lump together the expense of extending Bush tax cuts for 10 years with the costs related to increasing the Alternative Minimum Tax exemptions.
""Back when the (initial Bush) tax cuts were in play, a lot of people thought they wouldn‚Äôt be given any of the benefits of the tax cuts because more people would be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax,"" Peuquet said.
So let‚Äôs sum this up.
Scott says spending cuts required by the recent debt-limit deal pay half the cost of maintaining the Bush tax cuts through 2020.
Scott figures $2.1 trillion in spending reductions will result from the agreement. That‚Äôs the smallest amount of cuts Congress is required to make under the deal, but it‚Äôs a widely-used number because its set in stone.
The CBO says the total cost of extending the Bush tax cuts through 2020 is $3.9 trillion.
That means the spending cuts would equal 53.8 percent of the Bush tax cut costs through the end of the decade.
It‚Äôs questionable whether the divided Congress will agree on a bipartisan package of spending cuts and revenue increases to achieve the maximum $2.4 trillion goal in debt savings. If it does, the savings over the decade would equal 61.5 percent of the cost of extending the Bush tax cuts.
But three analysts said Scott‚Äôs use of the $2.1 trillion figure is solid.",Real News,0.9,2025-10-31 07:19:49.532596
admin,"Amid reports questioning Foxconn Technology Group's future in Wisconsin, Republican leaders issued a statement praising the Taiwanese technology titan for the impact its project has already had in the state.
The company has said it will build a $10 billion facility in Mount Pleasant to manufacture LCD panels and eventually employ 13,000. Those figures have appeared in doubt at times, including in January 2019 when news reports said the company was backing off or delaying its plans.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, released a joint statement on the company‚Äôs status Jan. 30, 2019. They covered a lot of territory, including some we‚Äôve already fact-checked.
They blamed new Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, for Foxconn‚Äôs waffling ‚Äî which we rated Pants on Fire .
They said ""not a dollar"" in state funds would go to Foxconn until jobs were created ‚Äî which we rated Mostly True .
And they addressed the impact Foxconn has already had in Wisconsin:
""In a short time, Foxconn has made a positive impact across Wisconsin with more than 1,000 new jobs, an investment of $200 million, three innovation centers and one of the largest gifts ever of $100 million to the UW-Madison,"" Vos and Fitzgerald said.
The jobs claim caught our eye.
Has Foxconn already been responsible for a four-figure bump in Wisconsin employment?
Number includes construction jobs
When asked for backup to the claim, Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer pointed us to a Jan. 17, 2019 letter Foxconn sent to state officials detailing the employment impact to date.
The letter said Foxconn ""created 1,032 direct jobs and many more indirect jobs in support of the Wisconsin project. This figure includes 178 full-time Foxconn employees and 854 employees involved in the construction of (the Foxconn campus), who are residents of 54 counties in Wisconsin.""
RELATED: See our Foxconn factchecks
(A quick aside: Those 178 Foxconn jobs were 82 short of the minimum required for the company to immediately claim the first year‚Äôs job-creation tax credits from the state. Foxconn could still make up those jobs later and get the funds , which are among the first of a promised $4 billion in public subsidies.)
So Foxconn is connected to more than 1,000 jobs, but reaching that number requires combining the company‚Äôs hiring with the temporary construction work generated by the building process.
Construction tally is cumulative
And there aren‚Äôt 1,000 current jobs.
Foxconn said the 854 construction jobs tally is a cumulative one that counts every Wisconsin worker who has been involved in the project since it began. It‚Äôs the most recent jobs report assembled by Gilbane Building Co., the project‚Äôs general contractor, and includes work done through the end of November 2018.
There were also several dozen construction workers from outside Wisconsin.
Most of those construction jobs no longer exist, though, since the phase of construction those workers were involved in has ended.
John Mielke, president of the Associated Builders and Contractors of Wisconsin, said a project the size of Foxconn likely has several hundred workers on site at a time.
Both Mielke and Pat O‚ÄôBrien, executive director of the regional development group Milwaukee 7 , said 854 construction jobs sounds reasonable for a project the size of Foxconn.",Real News,0.9,2025-10-31 07:20:01.590243

kane,"Gov. Charlie Crist launched what amounts to a nuclear attack in Republican politics during his FOX News Sunday showdown with Marco Rubio.
Crist labeled Rubio, the former House speaker, a tax raiser.
In a back and forth about each other's record on tax issues, Crist singled out Rubio's failed 2007 plan that would have eliminated property taxes for many Floridians in exchange for an increase to the state sales tax.
The tax swap ""would have been a massive tax increase,"" Crist said during the March 28, 2010, U.S. Senate debate. ""In all due respect to the speaker, you've just got to tell the truth to people. And that's really what this is all about.""
Rubio contends that the tax swap would have been a huge, net tax cut. And that the plan was supported by former Gov. Jeb Bush.
Would it have been a tax cut? Or a tax hike?
Let's take a look.
In his first months as speaker in early 2007, Rubio proposed a fundamental change in Florida's tax structure. The proposal would scratch property taxes on all primary residences. In its place, the state sales tax would be increased by 2.5 cents per dollar -- subject to voter approval.
